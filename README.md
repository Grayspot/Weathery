# [Weathery](https://github.com/Dursam/Weathery#readme) [![version][version-badge]][CHANGELOG]

Weathery is a little angular application that we wrote for our Web subject during the last year of computer science studies in university of Le Mans.
The purpose of the app, as the name implies, is pretty simple - it gives you current weather of the place you search.
It also has several minor functionalities, such as:
- Autocompletion of the search.
- Changing the background of the page to the photo of the place you searched for.
- A music player launches a track with ambient sounds corresponding to the current weather.

### Different API's we use in this app:
- Google Places (autocomplete, details, photos).
- OpenWeather (current weather information).
- Youtube API (fetching ambient sounds for current weather).


## App architecture (subject to change):

### Other info and documentation:
All the other documents (such as story-board, personas, graphics chart etc) are located in /docs/livrables/.
